        <p>
          I'm a fullstack software developer, currently based out of Provo, UT,
          driven to build your dream websites and applications. I've developed
          skills in Javascript, React, Express, Node.js, PostgreSQL, as well as
          other technologies, and I'm constantly looking to improve and am open
          to learning more technologies.
